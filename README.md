# Fun with socket.io and canvas

Trying out real-time game development using websockets and raw canvas.
the game renders a procedurally generated world that you can explore wuth fog of war and field of view. It also has a mini map. you can shoot fireballs and hurt other players.

you can preview this game:

- [Here if you live in the US](https://based-game-us.up.railway.app/)
- [Here if you live in Europe](https://based-game-eu.onrender.com/)

It will probably take forever to load because of free tier restrictions on the hosting providers :(

## Get Started

- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev`

or you can open 2 terminals separately and tun

- `yarn server dev`
- `yarn client dev`

Have fun !
